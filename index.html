                    <p>
                        Hey, I’m Emma! I’m a junior at UC San Diego studying computer engineering, originally from Alberta, Canada. 
                        I’ve always been passionate about software development and love diving into both front-end and back-end work. 
                        Right now, I’m working on multiple full-stack projects, constantly learning new technologies and finding ways 
                        to improve my skills. I enjoy the problem-solving side of coding—whether it’s designing intuitive user 
                        interfaces, optimizing backend performance, or figuring out how different systems work together. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, I love crocheting, especially making fun and cozy projects in my free time. 
                        I’m also a big fan of binge-watching Netflix, whether it’s a new thriller series or a feel-good sitcom. 
                        Staying active is important to me too—I enjoy doing Pilates to unwind and playing volleyball whenever 
                        I get the chance. I’m always up for trying new things, whether it’s learning a new framework, 
                        picking up a new hobby, or just taking on a new challenge.
                    </p>
